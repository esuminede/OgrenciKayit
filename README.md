# OgrenciKayit

This project created in Turkish. I coded this project for my internship in a TÃ¼rkish Technical High School - Computer Science section students. 
This is a MVC project that can do basic tasks : create ( ekle ), edit ( duzenle ), sil ( delete ) ve detay ( details ).
You can add students and write something about them. There is five column in database : OgrenciNo ( school number / id ), Sinif ( class ), Isim ( name ), Soyisim ( surname ) and Hakkinda ( about ).
